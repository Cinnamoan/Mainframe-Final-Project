# Mainframe-Final-Project-Winter2019
This is a group project that I was assigned along with two others (Roshan Persaud and Waqar Naseer) in my Mainframe Development (MAFD) class in Durham College. This project incorporates basic COBOL content that will be interlinked with four COBOL programs. More info on the project requirements can be found in the MAFD4202 Team Programming Project - Winter 2019 - v3.pdf.pdf file above.
